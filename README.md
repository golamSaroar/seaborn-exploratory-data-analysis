## Exploratory Data Analysis Using Seaborn

Producing visualizations is an important first step in exploring and analyzing real-world data sets. As such, visualization is an indispensable method in any data scientist's toolbox. It is also a powerful tool to identify problems in analysis and for illustrating results.  

In this project, the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, is used to discover and explore the relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The notebook includes various chart types including histograms, violin plots, box plots, joint plots, pair grids, and heatmaps, customize plot aesthetics, as well as methods to visualize higher dimensional data.

In addition to that, some data engineering methods such as- drop correlated features, implement feature selection and feature extraction methods including feature selection with correlation, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis (PCA) and tree based feature selection methods have also been used. Finally, a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost is built in order to to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.
